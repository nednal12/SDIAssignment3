    <h2>Project 3</h2>

<p>I decided to continue on with the 'Car' theme. However, I wanted to change up the
	storyline. So I decided to look into the future and imagine what it will be like
	to perform a tuneup on a car around the year 2050. I'll be checking the tires, 
	changing the oil and possibly the replacing the spark plugs.</p>
